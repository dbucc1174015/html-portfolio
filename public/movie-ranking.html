<h1>The Best Movies According to Dan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shaun of the Dead</h3>
<p>This is a hilarious zombie comedy with great performances.</p>
<h3>Clue</h3>
<p>Maybe the most unexpectedly hilarious movie based on a classic board game</p>
<h3>Cabin in the Woods</h3>
<p>A terrific horror with comedic elements that is about as tongue in cheek as a modern horror movie could be.</p>
