<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I've been learning programming for about 18 months. I started with Python and I never really felt like I got a great handle
  of it so I decided to try some front end work. I have now learned the basics of HTML and CSS and I feel like I have a 
  much better understanding of the basics of web development now. 
</p>

<p>I would tell you about who I am and what I do other than coding but that's not really any of your business. All you need
  to know is that I'm trying to learn as much as I can from this web development bootcamp as I can so that I can move into
  a new field when the time is right for me.
</p>

<p>I WILL tell you that when I'm not working or learning, I enjoy spending time playing videos games, training brazilian 
  jiu jitsu, playing the drums, playing golf, and watching horror movies. I also greatly enjoy comedy TV. 30 Rock is my favorite
  show.
